          An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of data and the
          relationships between entities within a database system. It is commonly used in database
          design and serves as a blueprint to model the structure of data before it is implemented
          in a database. ERDs were first introduced by Peter Chen in 1976 and have since become a
          standard tool in relational database design.

        <h2>Entities</h2>
        <p>
          An entity is any object, real or abstract, that exists by itself and can be clearly
          identified in an information system. Each entity instance is called an occurrence, and an
          entity is named after a "thing" it represents.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>
          Attributes are the data points that describe an entity. For example, in an entity like
          "Employee," attributes could include EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, and HireDate. Keys
          are special types of attributes that uniquely identify an entity. Each entity must have a
          primary key.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Primary Key: One or more attributes that uniquely identify an entity. For example,
            `EmployeeID` is often used as the primary key in an "Employee" entity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Foreign Key: An attribute that creates a link between two entities, often representing a
            relationship between them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Relationships</h2>
        <p>A relationship is an association between different entities.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1:N (One-to-Many): An entity in group 1 must be associated with one or more entities in
            group 2 (e.g., an invoice must have at least one invoice line).
          </li>
          <li>
            0:N (Zero-to-Many): An entity can be associated with many or no entities in another
            group (e.g., a car can have many extras or none).
          </li>
          <li>
            1:1 (One-to-One): An entity in one group must be associated with exactly one entity in
            another (e.g., a patient has one and only one medical history).
          </li>
          <li>
            0:1 (Zero-to-One): An entity in one group can be associated with one or no entities in
            another group (e.g., a purchase can have a discount or no discount).
          </li>
          <li>
            M:N (Many-to-Many): Entities in group 1 can be associated with multiple entities in
            group 2, and vice versa. For example, students can enroll in many courses, and each
            course can have many students. This type of relationship often requires a third entity,
            called a join or bridge table, to store the relationship.
