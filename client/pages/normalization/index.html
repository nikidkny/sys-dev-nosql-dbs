        <h1>Understanding Database Normalization</h1>
        <p>
          Database normalization is a process of organizing the columns (attributes) and tables
          (relations) of a database to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves
          splitting large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between
          them. The goal is to reduce duplicate data and ensure that the database is efficient and
          scalable.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>1st Normal Form (1NF): Eliminate Repeating Groups</h3>
        <p>
          In the first step of normalization, we ensure that each table contains atomic values. This
          means that each column should contain only one piece of information, and there should be
          no repeating groups.
        </p>

        <p>For example, initially, we may have a student table like this:</p>

        <div class="img-small">
          <img src="/public/images/lvl_0_n.jpg" alt="Level 0 Normalization" />
        </div>

        <p>
          In 1NF, we would split the "activities" column into separate rows for each activity to
          eliminate repeating groups:
        </p>
        <div class="img-small">
          <img src="/public/images/lvl_1_n.jpg" alt="Level 1 Normalization" />
        </div>

        <h3>2nd Normal Form (2NF): Eliminate Redundant Data</h3>
        <p>
          To move to the second normal form, we must remove partial dependencies, which means
          separating data that depends on only part of the primary key. Here, we split the
          activities into a separate table and create a relationship with the student table.
        </p>

        <p>
          We introduce a new table called <strong>student_activity_join</strong> to link students
          with their activities:
        </p>
        <p>Then, we have an <strong>activity</strong> table as well:</p>
        <img src="/public/images/lvl_2_n.jpg" alt="Level 2 Normalization" />

        <h3>3rd Normal Form (3NF): Remove Transitive Dependencies</h3>
        <p>
          The third normal form eliminates transitive dependencies, where non-key columns depend on
          other non-key columns. To resolve this, we introduce a <strong>topic</strong> table to
          manage the relationship between activities and their topics.
        </p>

        <p>
          We now have an <strong>activity_topic_join</strong> table, and finally, a
          <strong>topic</strong> table that stores topic information:
        </p>

        <img src="/public/images/lvl_3_n.jpg" alt="Level 3 Normalization" />

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          By normalizing the database into 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, we have created a set of related
          tables that minimize data redundancy and ensure data integrity. Each table serves a
          specific purpose, and relationships are defined using foreign keys. This approach makes
          the database more efficient, scalable, and easier to maintain.
